# Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm a second-year Rochester Institute of Technology student who is interested in all things technology, particularly with writing code and creating projects.

You'll find many of my personal projects hosted here. Feel free to check them out. I am fairly active on GitHub, so check back again soon for any future project updates.
