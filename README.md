# Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm a second-year Rochester Institute of Technology student who is interested in all things technology, particularly with writing code and creating projects.

You'll find many of my personal projects hosted here. Feel free to check them out. I am fairly active on GitHub, so check back again soon for any future project updates.

## My Latest Project

### Video Ticket Redemption Arcade

I have been working on a video ticket redemption arcade game, which is a physical full-size arcade cabinet which is designed to run games that I program for it. It can adapt to be any game, whether that be card games, game shows, trivia, and more.

The cabinet incorporates:

- **_TW-389 coin mechanism_**, processes .984" arcade tokens and filters out other invalid coins
- **_DL-1275 Arcade ticket dispenser_**, capable of holding up to 4000 real arcade tickets
- **_19" point-of-sale capacitive touch screen monitor_**, supports just about any game imaginable
- **_Dell Optiplex 7040 Micro PC running Ubuntu Desktop_**, configured to automatically turn on and launch the desired game on power up
- **_Custom DAQ module_**, communicates over the serial interface to the PC and handles all hardware inputs and outputs
- **_PC tray with mounted USB 3.0 port for flash drives_**, provides easy access to servicing hardware, USB port allows for loading new games and holds configuration data

### Maze Finger

The first game I am making for it is **Maze Finger**, a fast-paced maze game where the goal is to find the hidden exit as fast as possible. But be quick, the timer gets faster as you complete each level!

**Repository coming soon.**

### Other Game Ideas

Some other games I eventually want to make for this arcade cabinet:

- Wheel of Puzzles, a [Wheel of Fortune](https://www.wheeloffortune.com/) remake
- 4 Colors, an [UNO-style](https://www.unorules.com/) card game
