# Hi, I'm Ben.

I'm a second-year Rochester Institute of Technology student who is interested in all things technology, particularly with writing code and creating projects.

You'll find many of my personal projects hosted here. Feel free to check them out. I am fairly active on GitHub, so check back again soon for any future project updates.

## My Latest Project

I have been working on a video ticket redemption arcade game, which is a physical full-size arcade cabinet which is designed to run games that I program for it. It can adapt to be any game, whether that be card games, game shows, trivia, and more.

The first game I am making for it is Maze Finger, a fast-paced maze game where the goal is to find the hidden exit as fast as possible. But be quick, the timer gets faster as you complete each level!
